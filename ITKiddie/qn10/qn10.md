QUESTION: 10 HPA
Create a new HorizontalPodAutoScaler [HPA] named apache-server in the autoscale namespace.

Tasks:
1. This HPA must target the existing deployment called apache-deployment in the autoscale namespace.
2. Set the HPA to target for 50% CPU usage per Pod.
3. Configure the HPA to have a minimum of 1 pod and maximum of 4 pods. Also, we have to set the downscale stabilization window to 30 seconds.


```bash

kubectl autoscale deployment apache-server -n autoscale --cpu-percent=50 --min=1 --max=4 --horizontal-pod-autoscaler-downscale-stabilization=60


```
